	<p>That movie talks about a kid that was trapped in his dreams and his dreams actually started to turn into scary life people hunting him and wanting to kill him and his father was trapped in these when he was kid which seems mostly like it's moving for father to son and parents starting to use exorcism which actually allows his father to enter his dreams and save him. They are also creating a third part of it which I can't wait for which it ended in part 2 by one of the ladies that is doing the exorcism trying to save them in part 3 which will be released this summer.</p>
